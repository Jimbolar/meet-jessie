# meet-jessie

This is a personal website that I'm building for my daughter Jessica.

The main inspiration for the site was based around creating an online baby book. For some reason, they don't seem to exist on the internet.

It's going to take a while to get this up and running, but slow and steady wins the race...

Word.
